  <h1>About Us</h1>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At SCI-T, our mission is to advance science by promoting transparency, collaboration, and accessibility. We support both open science initiatives and private projects, empowering individuals and teams to make meaningful contributions to their fields while gaining recognition for their efforts.</p>

        <h2>SCI-T Points System</h2>
        <p>To motivate and recognize contributions, we have developed a <strong>Points System</strong> that rewards participants for their involvement in projects and activities:</p>

        <h3>Open Science Projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>+2 points</strong>: For participating in and completing an open science project.</li>
            <li><strong>+3 points</strong>: For leading an open science project to completion.</li>
            <li><strong>+1 point</strong>: For all team members who generate and present monthly reports.</li>
            <li><strong>+3 points</strong>: For creating a scientific article at the project's conclusion.</li>
            <li><strong>+4 points</strong>: For publishing the scientific article in a peer-reviewed journal.</li>
            <li><strong>+3 points</strong>: For writing a science communication article about the project on our platform.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Private Projects</h3>
        <p>Private projects are welcome but have slightly different incentives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 point less</strong>: For each activity compared to open science projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Mandatory</strong>: Once the final product is published in a journal of choice, a science communication article must be created on our platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> For private projects, reports will not be published and will remain strictly confidential.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Reports and Final Products</h2>
        <p>At SCI-T, we encourage transparency and knowledge sharing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reports from open science groups will be published on our platform for the community to learn and benefit from their progress.</li>
            <li>The final product of the project will also be shared as an open resource.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend that groups produce a scientific article based on their project, which can:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Be published in a scientific journal as a formal contribution.</li>
            <li>Generate a science communication article on SCI-T, including a hyperlink to the published scientific article for greater visibility.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For private projects, reports will not be shared, maintaining full confidentiality. However, upon final product publication, a science communication article must be published on our platform.</p>
        <p>We encourage authors to acknowledge <strong>SCI-T</strong> in their scientific articles for inspiring and supporting these projects.</p>

        <h2>Groups at SCI-T</h2>
        <p>We welcome and support various types of groups:</p>

            <li>Private groups</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a group proposes a project, it will be directly assigned to the proposing group for better management and organization. Additionally, active groups will earn:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 passive point per month</strong>: For maintaining consistent activity, regardless of ongoing projects.</li>
        </ul>
